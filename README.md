## üìñ Introduction

Our project focuses on developing a _Flutter-based mobile application_ designed to identify butterfly species native to Gujarat. Combining state-of-the-art AI technologies with an intuitive mobile experience, the app provides:

- _Real-time butterfly identification_ through image segmentation and classification.
- A _comprehensive catalog of 109 butterfly species_ with detailed information on each.
- Tools tailored for _researchers, enthusiasts, and conservationists_ to promote biodiversity awareness and conservation efforts.
